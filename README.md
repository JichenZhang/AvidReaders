## Project Deployment

### Database

The server expects a mysql database named 'goodreads2' with schema specified in `Database Specs.docx`.
It should be running on 127.0.0.1:3306, with username 'root' and password 'password'

### Server and Client

Open two terminal windows, one in directory /server, the other in directory /client.
In each one, run:

#### `yarn`

It will start installing the dependencies for each. After they finish, in both, run:

#### `yarn start`

A browser will automatically open with the application running. Have fun!
